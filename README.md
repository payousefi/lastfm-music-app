This is a small web app that connects to the Last.fm API and outputs top artists in a tiled layout + design. Users can input their own usernames to redirect to a shareable and custom URL for their own personal top artists page.

# History
Originally wrote this tool in May, 2014. Recently revamped with improved javascript, and better social sharing capabilities.

## Live Tool
A live version of the tool can be used [here](http://music.payamyousefi.com/).

## Inspirations
“What kind of music do you like?” is a common question, especially when making first impressions. For many, it's also the hardest kind of personality question! Musical tastes can vary seasonally, monthly, sometimes daily. Using jQuery, HTML5, CSS3, and the Last.fm API to retrieve music data, I built a tool that would help answer this question, both for myself and others.
